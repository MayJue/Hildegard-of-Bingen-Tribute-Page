<h3>About Hildegard</h3>
<p>

  In the 12th century, a woman by the name of Hildegard spoke out against the power of her time which result in her leaving a great mark in history. Hildegard was born in 1098 and was given to the church at the young age of eight. She lived her life as a nun with a deep secret that troubled her throughout her life. Hildegard was able to see vision but she told no one, hence her visions became a burden to her. Though Hildegard was timid and lack confidence in herself, she was able to become a powerful and significant figure in history through her vision that changes her life, in her 42 year of age.
